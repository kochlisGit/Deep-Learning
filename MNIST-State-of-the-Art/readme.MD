# State of the Art MNIST Classifier

This is an implementation of a similar-like LeNet CNN for MNIST Digit Classification. I have previously implemented that CNN, with a few changes in the parameters (https://github.com/kochlisGit/Deep-Learning/tree/master/MNIST
that it is performing even better than the original LeNet).
